TwoStepJS
=========

A jsPsych port of the `child-friendly <doi.org/10.1177/0956797616639301>`_ two-step task.

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This version of the two-step task uses a "space trading" cover story: Participants visit two different planets and trade with aliens found there. The colors and positions of the rocket ships, planets, and aliens are configurable according to the experimenter's preferences. For example, the rocket ships and planets can be made to have the same colors (e.g. red & blue), which can make explicit to the participant the first-stage transition matrix (e.g. common: blue-to-blue, uncommon: blue-to-red). Moreover, the rocket ship and alien positions can be changed across trials to discourage choice autocorrelation or side biases.

To note, the experiment in this repository currently matches the rocket ship and planet colors. Moreover, rocket ship and alien positions are static across trials.

Serving Experiments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
