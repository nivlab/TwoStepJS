var instructions_01 = ['Welcome to the Treasure Hunting Game! Here, you will be hunting for treasure in outer space. You can use the arrow keys to navigate.'];

var instructions_02 = ['In this game, you can hunt for treasure on two different planets with the help of some aliens.'];

var instructions_03 = ['Each planet has two aliens that live there. Each alien has its very own mine for treasure hunting! When you ask an alien for treasure, it will dig in its mine to look for some.'];

var instructions_04 = ['All the aliens are nice, so if they can find treasure in their mine, they will give it to you. This is what space treasure looks like!'];

var instructions_05 = ['If an alien cannot find treasure in its mine, it will not want to come back empty-handed, so it will bring you back some rocks instead.'];

var instructions_06 = ['Each alien is slowly changing where it digs for treasure in its mine. Sometimes it digs in a spot where it is easy to find treasure. Then it will find treasure most of the time, but not every time. Sometime the alien digs in a spot where it is hard to find treasure. There it might sometimes find treasure, but it will usually find rocks.'];

var instructions_07 = ['The aliens are slowly changing where they are looking for treasure in their mines. To find the most treasure, you will have to pay attention to which alien is digging in a place that is easy to find treasure right now.'];

var instructions_08 = ['<b>Your goal is to find out which alien is digging where there is more treasure.</b><br><br><b>Hint:</b> The aliens might change sides, but they still each dig in their own mine, so it does not matter what side the alien is standing on when you ask it.'];

var instructions_09 = ['We will practice asking these two aliens for treasure. You can ask the alien on the left by pressing the LEFT ARROW KEY. You can ask the alien on the right by pressing the RIGHT ARROW KEY. <br><br>Press the next button to start practicing!'];

var instructions_10 = ['Great! You might have learned that this alien was currently looking in a place that was easy to dig for treasure.'];

var instructions_11 = ['There are some helpful hints for treasure hunting with the aliens.'];

var instructions_12 = ['<b>Hint 1:</b> Aliens change where they are looking in their mines only slowly. So if an alien is looking in a place where it is easy to find treasure right now, it will probably keep looking there for a while. If an alien is looking in a place where it is hard to find treasure right now, it will probably also keep looking there for a while.'];

var instructions_13 = ['<b>Hint 2:</b> If one alien is digging in a place where it is hard to find treasure, that does not mean the other one is digging in a place where it is easy to find treasure. The aliens will try their best to find treasure and will not try to trick you.'];

var instructions_14 = [`Before you can ask an alien for some treasure, you will first need to travel to their planet! There are two rocketships and two planets. Most of the time, the <b>COLOR</b> rocketship will go to the </b>COLOR</b> planet. Most of the time the <b>COLOR</b> rocketship will go to the COLOR planet.`];

var instructions_15 = ['Each rocketship goes to its preferred planet most of the time. But sometimes a rocketship has a problem and goes to the other planet by accident. It is rare that a rocketship has a problem though.'];

var instructions_16 = ['Practice choosing the rocketships to learn which planet they go to most often.'];

var instructions_17 = ['Great! Now we can practice the whole game. You will first choose which rocketship to take. Once you make it to a planet, there will be two aliens. You can only ask one alien for treasure per trip. Remember you are trying to get as much space treasure as you can! We will try practicing 20 flights.'];

var instructions_18 = ['Great job! This game can be hard, so you will need to concentrate. Before we get started, we will do some review.'];
